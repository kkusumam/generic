'''
The code block you provided computes the frequency of the hand key points in a given window and uses the number of peaks in the frequency spectrum as a feature for tremor classification.

compute_fft(window_data[:, :2]): This function computes the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the x and y coordinates of the hand key points in a given window. The output of this function is a frequency spectrum freq_loc and a complex FFT array _ for the x and y coordinates.
np.abs(freq_loc[:window_size//2]) / window_size: This line computes the absolute values of the frequency spectrum and normalizes it by dividing it by the window size. This is because the output of the FFT is generally in complex form and by taking the absolute values, we can convert the output to a real number, which can be more easily interpreted.
find_peaks(freq_loc): This function finds the peaks in the frequency spectrum. A peak represents a frequency that occurs more frequently in the data than other frequencies. The function returns the indices of the peaks.
X[i, 12] = np.mean(peaks) and X[i, 13] = np.std(peaks): These lines compute the mean and standard deviation of the indices of the peaks in the frequency spectrum, and store them as features in the feature matrix X. These features are used for tremor classification, where the mean and standard deviation of the peaks can indicate the presence and severity of tremors
